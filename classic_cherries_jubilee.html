        <h1>Classic Cherries Jubilee</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Cherries jubilee is a refreshing dessert, especially after a hearty meal. This does have to be prepared immediately before serving, but does not take a lot of time. Your guests will enjoy the blue flames when the brandy is ignited!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>¼ cup cold water</li>
            <li>¼ cup orange juice</li>
            <li>1 pound Bing or other dark, sweet cherries, rinsed and pitted (or use frozen pitted cherries)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon finely grated orange zest</li>
            <li>3 cups vanilla bean ice cream</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cherry extract</li>
            <li>¼ cup brandy</li>
  
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk sugar and cornstarch together in a wide saucepan. Stir in water and orange juice; bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking until thickened. Stir in cherries and orange zest; return to a boil, then reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. While cherries are cooking, spoon ice cream into serving bowls.</li><p></p>

            <li>Remove cherries from heat and stir in cherry extract. Pour in brandy and ignite with a long lighter. Gently shake the pan until blue flame has extinguished itself. Spoon cherries over ice cream.</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>Notes on flambeing:</h3>
        <p><em>The flames may get quite high when flambéing, so pay attention to anything flammable above and around where you ignite the cherries. When the initial large flame has died down, a small blue flame will continue to burn for several seconds. Shake or stir the cherries gently to expose more alcohol to the flame, being careful that they do not burn. The goal is to have the small, blue flame burn for as long as possible, thereby reducing the raw alcohol flavor, caramelizing the sugars, and entertaining your guests!</em></p>
